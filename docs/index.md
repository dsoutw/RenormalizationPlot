# Renormalization Plot

This is a Python program that can renormalize unimodal maps. 
It can renormalize any one-parameter family of unimodal maps.
The plan is to also extend the functions to Henon-like maps. 
The program is released under the GNU General Public License version 3.

### A period-three renormalizable unimodal map
The first two images shows a period-three renormalizable unimodal map.
The boxes (and vertical lines that define the intervals) are the period intervals that define the self-return map.

The third image shows the levels of rescaling.

### A three-time renormalizable unimodal map (period 3-2-5 type)
The map f is period-three renormalizable. The renormalization Rf is period-two renormalizable. The second renormalization R<sup>2</sup>f is period-five renormalizable.
The picture shows f, Rf, R<sup>2</sup>f, and R<sup>3</sup>f at the same time and includes the topological features of the maps.

### The Route of Period Doubling.
Consider a one-parameter family of unimodal maps. 
As the parameter increases, the attracting fixed point bifurcates into an attracting period-two orbit of period two and a repelling fixed point. 
Then the attracting period-two orbit bifurcates into an attracting period-four orbit and a repelling period-two orbit.
This procedure repeats as the parameter increases.
